# SOAPUIReportingTool

It started as a simple project for my engineer's degree. Everything was done as fast as possible and needs a proper cleanup, that's why it is so messy.

It should work when configured properly(config.cfg). 
I included a sample SOAPUI project "CountryInfoService-soapui-project.xml".


My 'tool' was designed as a substitute for pdf report generation that is available in SOAPUI Pro version.
Basic reports for functional tests are working.
